    :wave: I have been contributing to some open source projects in Javascript.I have always been a curious individual, which is why I’d love to collaborate and do some real-world projects in order to flourish my skills. I'm very far from perfection, yet I'm resilient, assertive and stubborn and I find learning a fascinating process.
      <br><em>Feel free to reach out to me with some advice, I’d love to hear some constructive criticism about any of my projects!:sparkles:<br><br>
