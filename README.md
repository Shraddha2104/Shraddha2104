    :wave: Hi! I am a GitHub's MLH Fellow 2020.
    <br>I have been contributing to some open source projects in Javascript.I have always been a curious individual, which is why Iâ€™d love to collaborate and do some real-world projects in order to flourish my skills. I'm very far from perfection, yet I'm resilient, assertive and stubborn and I find learning a fascinating process.
      <br><em>Feel free to reach out to me with some advice, Iâ€™d love to hear some constructive criticism about any of my projects!:sparkles:<br><br>
